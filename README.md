TBAnnotationClustering
======================

Example project from [blog post](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-to-handle-large-amounts-of-data-on-maps/).

Quad Tree
---------
If you want to grab the quad tree you can get it from my [GitHub](https://github.com/theocalmes/TBQuadTree)

or just install using cocoapods

```pod 'TBQuadTree', '~> 0.0'```

Swift Version
--------------
Added a Swift version of the code as an attempt at playing with Swift and figuring out Objective-C code.
Note: this is not an exemplary Swift code, I'm still trying to figure out the best way past all this explict casting hell and might missed some memory management problems.
